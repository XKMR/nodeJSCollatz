# nodeJSCollatz
a nodejs code that has some useful Collatz Conjecture functions
the example program will be looking through numbers and calculating collatz conjecture for them
to find the mosts steps resulting from an inputed number in the variable "max"
highest value I have tried for max is: 10175700
